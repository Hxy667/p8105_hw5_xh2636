```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
# Load the raw data
path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"

homicide_data <- read.csv(path)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
obs <- nrow(homicide_data)
colum <- ncol(homicide_data)
```

The raw data is about `r obs` criminal homicides over the past decade in 50 of the largest American cities with `r colum` columns. The data included the location of the killing, whether an arrest was made and, in most cases, basic demographic information about each victim. 

```{r}
# Adding the city state variable
homicide_data <- homicide_data %>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "))

# summarize within cities, the total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides
city_summary <- homicide_data %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", 
                                                "Open/No arrest"))
  )
```

```{r}
Baltimore_MD <- homicide_data %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  summarise(total_homicides = n(),
            unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", 
                                                "Open/No arrest")))

baltimore_test <- prop.test(x = pull(Baltimore_MD, unsolved_homicides)
                           , n = pull(Baltimore_MD, total_homicides)) %>%
  broom::tidy() %>%
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

baltimore_test %>% knitr::kable()
```
